# chatcrypt

**Decentralized TUI E2E encrypted chat app written in Go**

---

## How it works
- Message encryption and decryption happens on the client
- Anyone can self-host their own server
- Messages are stored locally in SQLite DBs
- Server stores unread encrypted messages temporarily until user fetches them to their local DB
